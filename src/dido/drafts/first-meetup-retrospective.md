As the host (and introvert?), I wanted to make sure that no one felt excluded from any group discussion. Luckily, the small group that came seemed to immediately feel comfortable with each other and the office.

I prepared a list of topics, ice breakers, and a general list of things I can do as a host to coax people out of their shells. I didn't need them at all.

10/10 would host again.
