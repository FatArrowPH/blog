    Manila Web Makers CSS:nth-of-type(1) Meetup Notes
---

The [Manila Web Makers][https://www.facebook.com/groups/ManilaWebMakers/] held its first meetup on May 13, 2016. Organizing and hosting meetups is a new thing for us at Fat Arrow and it's something we'd love to do regularly. We learned quite a bit from the experience which I'll detail in a different post. This one is about the talks.

## Jerico Aragon
Jerico Aragon, Senior Web Developer and Solutions Architect at Netfluence Corporation, shared his thoughts and experience in choosing which CSS pre-processor to adopt.


## Datu Arellano
Datu Arellano, co-founder and instructor at Fat Arrow, clued us in on the `cubic-bezier` CSS function.


## Karlo Abapo
Karlo Abapo, Quality Assurance Manager at YOYO Holdings, gave an improptu talk on the context driven approach to testing software.
